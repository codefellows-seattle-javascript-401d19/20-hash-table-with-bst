## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to implement a hash table which resolves collisions using a binary search tree.

## Set Up
1. Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
2. Run 'npm i --save jest' to save jest for testing purposes
3. To test all methods run 'npm test'

## Methods
** note: for all methods the key MUST be a String

1. set(key, value): Create a new entry in the hash table using the "set" method. Provide the key and value you wish to create; the value can be any type but remember the key must be a String.

2. get(key): Retrieve an existing entry with the specified key value. If an entry is found with a matching key that entry will be returned. If no entry is found with the specified key null will be returned.

3. remove(key): Remove an existing entry with the specified key value. If an entry is found with a matching key that entry will be deleted. If no entry is found with a matching key undefined will be returned.
